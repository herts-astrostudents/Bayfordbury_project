"""
To access the Bayfordbury archive you need an API key and your Observer ID.
Obtain those in your account at https://observatory.herts.ac.uk/telescopes/myaccount.php

This is an example of a credentials file.
Make one in tests/ or scripts/ directories and import them to the scripts/tests (see tests/test_api.py).
Everyone has their own set of credentials and should create their own credentials.py, so I added it to the .gitignore.
